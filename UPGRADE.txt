Upgrading from Atrium 1.0-beta3.x to 1.0-beta4
==============================================

_note: This upgrade assumes that you're using drush 3.x_

1. Change the name of the install profile on your site. While the update will
  run if you have a symlink from `openatrium` to `atrium_installer` in your
  `profiles` directory, it is a good idea to update this information for your
  site explicitly.

        drush vset install_profile openatrium

  Or add the following line to the end of your site's `settings.php` file:

        $conf['install_profile'] = 'openatrium';

2. Clear all caches.

        drush cc all

3. Run `update.php` in a web browser or run the following using drush:

        drush updatedb

4. Overrides for features need to be reverted. If you have made custom
  overrides to Atrium features, you will want to manage these yourself in the
  Features UI. Otherwise simply blow away all the overrides:

        drush -y features-revert atrium atrium_groups atrium_members atrium_profile
        drush -y features-revert atrium_blog atrium_book atrium_calendar atrium_casetracker atrium_shoutbox spaces_dashboard

5. Clear caches again. The site should now be (for the most part) usable.

6. Older installations may need to manually reset the default input format.

  1. Goto `admin/settings/filters`
  2. Select the desired format, eg 'Markdown'
  3. Click 'Set default format'

  If you have had to reset the default format, you may also need to manually set the allow tags. Below are some tags to get you going:

        <div> <span> <br> <a> <em> <strong> <cite> <code> <strike> <ul> <ol> <li> <dl> <dt> <dd> <img> <blockquote> <p> <pre> <h1> <h2> <h3> <h4> <h5> <h6> <table> <caption> <thead> <th> <td> <tr> <sup> <sub>

7. There maybe other variable that need to be reset

  1. Goto `admin/settings/strongarm`
  2. Select the desired variables, eg `site_404`
  3. Click 'Reset to defaults'
