Upgrading between any versions from Atrium 1.0-beta4 to 1.0-beta8
=================================================================

_note: If upgrading a version older than beta 4, update to beta 4 first_

1. Backup both the code and database of your old Atrium site.

2. Replace your Atrium codebase by moving your old Atrium drupal directory out
   of the way and replacing it with the new Atrium directory (this ensures that
   any files that have been moved or deleted are properly cleaned up). Be sure
   to preserve the files directory of your site (usually `sites/[x]/files`)
   and any site-specific modules, themes and settings.

3. Clear your caches using `drush cc all` or clicking the `Clear cached data`
   button on the `admin/settings/performance` page.

4. Run any database updates using `drush updb` or `update.php`.

5. For more detail on steps 1-4 above see

   https://community.openatrium.com/documentation-en/node/1942

**The following steps are specific to Atrium 1.0-beta8**

6. Run `drush -y fr-all` to revert all of your features. Very important if you
   overrode any views, contexts, variable, permissions, and other configuration,
   on your site. This will delete your overrides and set everything back to the
   default Open Atrium configuration as defined in the code.

   If you've made extensive overrides you will want to carefully manage this
   step and preserve or recreate configuration overrides.

7. The last required step is to clear your caches again (see step 3). If you
   clear the cache from `admin/settings/performance` do not be alarmed if your
   theme is not working correctly; it should work correctly after you've
   cleared the cache (issue for reference only http://drupal.org/node/545452).


Upgrading from Atrium 1.0-beta3.x to 1.0-beta4
==============================================

_note: This upgrade assumes that you're using drush 3.x_

1. Change the name of the install profile on your site. While the update will
  run if you have a symlink from `openatrium` to `atrium_installer` in your
  `profiles` directory, it is a good idea to update this information for your
  site explicitly.

        drush vset install_profile openatrium

  Or add the following line to the end of your site's `settings.php` file:

        $conf['install_profile'] = 'openatrium';

2. Clear all caches.

        drush cc all

3. Run `update.php` in a web browser or run the following using drush:

        drush updatedb

4. Overrides for features need to be reverted. If you have made custom
  overrides to Atrium features, you will want to manage these yourself in the
  Features UI. Otherwise simply blow away all the overrides:

        drush -y features-revert atrium atrium_groups atrium_members atrium_profile
        drush -y features-revert atrium_blog atrium_book atrium_calendar atrium_casetracker atrium_shoutbox spaces_dashboard

5. Clear caches again. The site should now be (for the most part) usable.

6. Older installations may need to manually reset the default input format.

  1. Goto `admin/settings/filters`
  2. Select the desired format, eg 'Markdown'
  3. Click 'Set default format'

  If you have had to reset the default format, you may also need to manually set the allow tags. Below are some tags to get you going:

        <div> <span> <br> <a> <em> <strong> <cite> <code> <strike> <ul> <ol> <li> <dl> <dt> <dd> <img> <blockquote> <p> <pre> <h1> <h2> <h3> <h4> <h5> <h6> <table> <caption> <thead> <th> <td> <tr> <sup> <sub>

7. There maybe other variable that need to be reset

  1. Goto `admin/settings/strongarm`
  2. Select the desired variables, eg `site_404`
  3. Click 'Reset to defaults'
